# mf6api_test_cases
 A repository of example applications of the MODFLOW API.


This repository contains contains experimental applications of the MODFLOW API. They are exploratory and may be wrong. 


**Install Python and dependencies:**
 - If you have already installed Python using Anaconda, you can skip this step. If not, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), if you prefer )
 - If you are using __Windows__: go to the start menu and open "Anaconda prompt". An anaconda command line window will open. On __Linux__ or __MacOS__, just use the stndard terminal. Navigate to the course repo folder on your machine. You can accomplish this by typing "cd *your folder path*" and pressing < enter >. Replace *your folder path* with the path to the course material folder on your computer.
 - Next, type `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create an anaconda environment called "apitest" and install the python dependencies required for this course. It may take a while. Should you wish, you can inspect the *environment.yml* file in the repo folder to see what dependecies are being installed.
